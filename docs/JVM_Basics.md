# JVM Basics

## What is JDK, JRE, and JVM?
**JDK (Java Development Kit)**  
JDK is a software package used by developers to write, compile, and run Java programs. It includes the compiler (javac), JRE, and other development tools.

**JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**  
JRE provides the libraries and environment required to run Java applications. It does not include development tools like the compiler.

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**  
JVM is responsible for executing Java bytecode. It acts as an intermediary between Java programs and the operating system.

## What is Bytecode?
When a Java program is compiled, it is converted into an intermediate format called **bytecode**.  
This bytecode is not machine-specific and is executed by the JVM.

## Write Once, Run Anywhere
Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any system that has a compatible JVM.  
This allows developers to write the program once and run it on different operating systems without changing the code.
